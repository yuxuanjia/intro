        <img src="/intro/3.png" alt="Digital Mei Lanfang Image">
      </div>
      <p>Jointly developed by The Central Academy of Drama and Beijing Institute of Technology, the "Digital Mei Lanfang" project pioneers a standardized approach to the digital recreation of historical figures. Through advanced real-time technologies, it faithfully reconstructs Mei Lanfang's appearance, movement, voice, and performance, creating China's first truly interactive "digital twin" of a Peking Opera master. The project sets a benchmark for the preservation and digital asset management of Chinese cultural figures.</p>

    <div class="project-content">
      <div class="media-container">
        <img src="/intro/4.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <p>The Central Academy of Drama has pioneered the integration of motion capture, facial capture, and machine learning technologies for the digital preservation and transmission of traditional Chinese theatre. By applying motion capture, generative adversarial networks, and interdisciplinary research methods, the project systematically collects and reconstructs the endangered techniques of Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, and other forms. It extracts master-level stylistic features to build a "cultural genome" database of representative artists, supporting the development of intelligent, interactive learning systems and offering a human-machine collaborative solution for high-level heritage preservation.</p>

        <img src="/intro/6.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <p>"The Shape of Time – Peking Opera" explores the representation of time through dynamic imagery combined with motion capture data. Rather than simply visualizing the movement of renowned Peking Opera performers, the project materializes and solidifies the traces of performers' gestures across the dimensions of time and space, creating dynamic "gesture-time sculptures" that embody both motion and texture.</p>
      <div class="media-container">
        <img src="/intro/7.png" alt="Image">
      </div>
      <p>The work was unveiled during "China Night" at the 58th Venice Biennale in May 2019 and was also exhibited at the 2019 Asian Digital Art Exhibition, a supporting event of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations. By innovatively digitizing traditional theatrical expression, it celebrates the richness of Chinese heritage and attracted significant media attention, with over 200,000 visitors both online and offline.</p>
      <p>This project marks an important exploration of transforming traditional Peking Opera into the realm of visual and spatial art, integrating it into a global artistic language.</p>

        <img src="/intro/8.png" alt="Rhyme of Ice and Snow Image">
      </div>
      <p>The project team provided the Data Sculpture digital art installation for the Beijing Winter Olympics. Rhyme of Ice and Snow (RIS) presents a transparent three-dimensional display space constructed with staggered LED screens. Leveraging 3DAT technology, it abstractly transforms the motion trajectories of winter athletes into dynamic visuals resembling Chinese ink painting and snow particles, creating a sculptural effect rich in movement and texture. Artificial intelligence technologies were further employed to sense audience presence, applause, and cheers, enabling real-time interaction between the dynamic imagery and the viewers. This work exemplifies an innovative convergence of sports data, traditional aesthetics, and interactive digital art.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Jing Haishan is an innovative immersive theatre production that creates a fully sensory, interactive experience within a technologically enhanced "IN-BOX" environment. Set in a 24m × 16m × 9m black box theatre at the Tao Xichuan Immersive Digital Performance Laboratory, the piece integrates live music, visual projections, installation art, aerial performance, and dance.
      Using six ultra-bright 4K projectors controlled by real-time rendering engines, the space transforms dynamically in response to the performers' movements. Equipped with surround-stage aerial rigging, actors traverse walls as if they were floors, performing gravity-defying choreography. Ultra-wideband tracking technology precisely monitors performers' positions in three-dimensional space, seamlessly linking video, audio, and lighting systems to trigger real-time special effects. Jing Haishan exemplifies the future of interactive, multi-sensory theatre, dissolving the boundaries between performer and audience.</p>
